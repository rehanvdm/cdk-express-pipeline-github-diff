# CDK Express Pipeline GitHub Diff

A GitHub Action that generates and displays [CDK Express Pipeline](https://github.com/rehanvdm/cdk-express-pipeline)
diffs directly in your pull request description, providing clear visibility into infrastructure changes grouped by
waves, stages and stacks.

## Features

- üîç **Automated Diff Generation**: Automatically generates CDK diffs for Express Pipeline stacks on pull requests
- üåä **Wave-based Organization**: Displays diffs organized by pipeline waves and stages for better readability
- üì¶ **Stack-level Details**: Shows detailed resource changes (additions, updates, deletions) for each stack
- üîÑ **Parallel Diffs**: CDK Diff your app faster by breaking them into multiple jobs (matrix supported)
- üéØ **Selective Diffing**: Stack selectors to diff specific waves/stages/stacks enabling the use of parallel diff jobs
- üìù **Visual Diff on PR Description**: Updates pull request descriptions with formatted diff output
- üîç **Full output on Action Summary**: Updates action/job run summary with the full diff output for easy access

## Usage

There are multiple ways to use this action depending on your workflow needs. Below shows a basic example where a single
job generates and displays diffs. Then a more complex example that uses matrix jobs to generate diffs in parallel and
then combines the output.

### Basic Usage

For simple workflows where you generate and display diffs in a single job:

```yaml
name: CDK Diff
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  cdk-diff:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Configure AWS credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
        with:
          role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/your-github-deploy-role
          aws-region: us-east-1
      - name: Synthesize CDK
        run: npm run cdk -- synth '**'
      - name: Generate CDK Diff
        uses: rehanvdm/cdk-express-pipeline-github-diff@v1
        with:
          mode: 'generate'
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      - name: Update PR with Diff
        uses: rehanvdm/cdk-express-pipeline-github-diff@v1
        with:
          mode: 'print'
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Complex example with Parallel Diffs using Matrix

For matrix workflows where you generate diffs across multiple jobs and combine the output:

```yaml
name: CDK Diff Matrix
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  generate-diffs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
      id-token: write
    strategy:
      matrix:
        include:
          - job-name: Diff default - wave1
            selectors: 'Wave1_*'
          - job-name: Diff default - wave2
            selectors: 'Wave2_*'
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Configure AWS credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
        with:
          role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/your-github-deploy-role
          aws-region: us-east-1
      - name: Synthesize CDK
        run: npm run cdk -- synth '**'
      - name: Generate CDK Diff
        uses: rehanvdm/cdk-express-pipeline-github-diff@v1
        with:
          mode: 'generate'
          stack-selectors: ${{ matrix.stack-group }}
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          job-name: ${{ matrix.job-name }}

  print-diffs:
    needs: generate-diffs
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - name: Update PR with Combined Diffs
        uses: rehanvdm/cdk-express-pipeline-github-diff@v1
        with:
          mode: 'print'
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Inputs

| Input                      | Description                                                    | Required | Default           |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| `mode`                     | Action mode: `generate` to create diffs, `print` to update PR  | ‚úÖ       | -                 |
| `cloud-assembly-directory` | Directory containing the CDK Cloud Assembly                    | ‚ùå       | `cdk.out`         |
| `stack-selectors`          | Comma-separated stack selectors or patterns to diff            | ‚ùå       | `**` (all stacks) |
| `github-token`             | GitHub token for API access and caching                        | ‚úÖ       | -                 |
| `job-name`                 | Name of the job, used to link to action/job logs in summaries. | ‚ùå       | -                 |

## Example Outputs

### PR Description output

The action will append a formatted diff to the pull request description, it will never overwrite the existing
description. Here‚Äôs an example of what it looks like:

![img.png](docs/imgs/pr_description.png)

### Action Summary output

The action will also update the action/job summary with the full CDK diff output without any changes:

![img.png](docs/imgs/action_summary.png)

## How It Works

1. **Generate Mode**:
   - You must run `cdk synth` before using this action to generate the cloud assembly
   - Analyzes your CDK Express Pipeline assembly
   - Creates detailed diffs for each stack showing resource changes and creates the action/job summaries
   - Caches the diff data for retrieval by the print mode job
2. **Print Mode**:
   - Retrieves all cached diff data from previous generate jobs
   - Combines diffs according to the pipeline wave/stage structure
   - Updates the pull request description with formatted diff output

## Stack Selectors

The `stack-selectors` input supports various patterns:

- `**` - All stacks (default)
- `Wave1_*` - All stacks in all stages for `Wave1`
- `Wave1_Stage1_*,Wave1_Stage2_*` - All stacks in `Stage1` and `Stage2` for `Wave1`

[CDK Express Pipeline documentation](https://rehanvdm.github.io/cdk-express-pipeline/guides/selective-deployment/)

## FAQ

### What happens if I have a big diff and it exceeds the GitHub comment size limit?

The diff will be truncated, 260kb is a lot of space and most will not have this issue. However, if you do hit the limit,
the action will still update the pull request description up to the limit and indicate it was truncated. The full diff
will still be available in the action summary and you can always find it in the action logs.

### Why not places the diff in a comment(s)?

Placing comments creates a lot of noise and can clutter the pull request discussion, especially when doing many parallel
diffs where each diff is a comment. Instead, this action updates the pull request description and action summary with
the diff, providing a cleaner and more organized view of changes. Accepting the 260KB description limit is a trade-off
for a cleaner PR experience.
